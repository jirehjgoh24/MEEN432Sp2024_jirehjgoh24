Steps to Run Simulation:
1. Download Project 4 files
2. First Run P4init 
3. Second Run Project_4 Simulink
4. Third Run Run_Project_4 
5. Should produce a graph with a vehicle going around the track

Work Done:
Combine projects 2 and 3. Project 2 can be visualized as the physical driver turning the wheels. Project 3 can be visualized as the breaking and throttling of the vehicle. Given the complex vehicle dynamics, there are still errors with the car staying on the track. However, the car should complete laps around still. 

Things to Note:
Completion of this assignment was possible with collaboration from team members and classmates outside of my originally assigned group.
